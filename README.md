This project is a "Mail-merge" type project for Google.  A simple google form, which connects to hosted inventory, provides fields for sales representatives to populate with requested customer quotes.

This code then reads the data, copies it, duplicates the Template file, and replaces all applicable fields in that file with the requested information, including a photo of the product in inventory.
